            demonstrate different surveys with a great diversity of topics so
            that they respond to the opinion of each user. The app was half
            done, we showed the surveys, user creations, and the rewards area.
            Every feature was made from scratch.

            Desktop Game application with keyboard and mouse. The Game app was
            requested to demonstrate how to develop a Game in 3D, from a
            third-person shooter. Apart from basic 3d models, every feature was
            made from scratch. Developed in unity (using C#) and blender for
            creating 3D models to be applied in the development of the game app.

              questions about employee behavior and how they used work
              equipment.
